## Synopsis

This is an open-source project specifically designed for smaller animal rescues, to keep track of the medical, behavioral, and other needs of their residents.

## Motivation

There is software available for large-scale animal sanctuaries and shelters. Prior to this effort, nothing had existed for the "little guy". As a veterinarian who quit clinical practice, animals are near and dear to my heart, and a close friend of mine founded [Hope Haven Farm Sanctuary](http://www.hopehavenfarm.org/), a home for abandoned or abused farm animals. However, she had no easy way to communicate to her volunteers what each animal needed.

## API Reference

Code for the API can be found in app.py.

## Usage

This site is deployed at [Sanctuary Secretary](http://www.sanctuarysecretary.com), if you'd like to take a look, and it's a work-in-progress.

## Thanks to!

I used Bonnie Eisenman's [React-Flask](https://github.com/bonniee/react-flask) tutorial to initially set up the files for this project. If you are looking to set up a React application using a backend Flask API, Babel, and Webpack, I highly recommend it! She goes into setting up a virtual environment, installing Webpack, and running both 'webpack --watch' and 'python app.py'.
